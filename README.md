# MLP-for-Optimal-Equity-Derivative-Hedging
## Award Recognition üèÜ
**1st Place Certificate** ‚Äì **Bay Area Data Science Summit 2025 (BADSS2025)**  
Our work was recognized for **innovation, robustness, and practical financial applications** by experts from **UC Berkeley and Wells Fargo**.

## Overview
This project presents a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based framework** for **optimal equity derivative hedging**, developed as part of our award-winning participation in the **Bay Area Data Science Summit 2025 (BADSS2025)**. Our team won the **1st Place Certificate**, competing against teams from **UC Berkeley, Stanford, UC Davis, and other top institutions**, and received high recognition from **UC Berkeley professors and industry experts from Wells Fargo**.

Our model leverages:
- **Advanced deep learning techniques** to optimize hedging strategies.
- **Real-time data processing** for dynamic risk management.
- **Exposure-PnL mapping** to balance profitability and risk.
- **A smart buy-sell greedy strategy** that adapts to market fluctuations.

Our experimental results demonstrate **substantial cost reduction and enhanced risk mitigation**, making our approach highly applicable for algorithmic trading in real-world financial markets.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling missing data**: Filling in gaps while preserving data integrity.
- **Time series alignment**: Ensuring consistent tracking of options data.
- **PnL & Exposure calculations**: Computing key risk and profitability metrics.

### 2. Labeling and Network Training
- **Novel Labeling Mechanism**: A PnL-Exposure trade-off function for prioritizing options.
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**:
  - Architecture: **128 ‚Üí 64 ‚Üí 32 ‚Üí 1**
  - **5-fold cross-validation** to prevent overfitting.
  - Optimized for **non-linear market relationships**.

### 3. Decision Logic
- **Dynamic exposure control**: Meeting daily exposure targets of **‚â• $10M**.
- **Buy-sell execution strategy**:
  1. **Managing existing sell orders** via a structured dictionary.
  2. **Iterative purchase adjustment** based on ranked option labels.
  3. **Real-time exposure updates** ensuring risk-aware trading decisions.

## Key Results
